For every request with actions (e.g. not just a simple question) take the following steps:

1. **Start in plan mode** - Start by analyzing the request and planning out a series of steps that you plan to take before doing any work
2. **Present plan** - Present the plan as the series of steps asking for any feedback
3. **Present final plan** - After taking in feedback update plan if needed and always ask for confirmation before beginning work.
